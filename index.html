<p>Hello, my name is Stephen Baker. I am a sports management major at Bob Jones University. I am interested in sports and music,<br>
especially singing. My dream is to be an athletic director / coach in a middle school or high school. I have competed in a team<br>
consumer science competition for six years, in a competition called <a href="http://www.lifesmarts.org">LifeSmarts</a> where my team represented my home state<br>
of Virginia in national rounds in Florida (2014) and Washington State (2015). I have also had the privilege of singing the national anthem at<br>
the annual HEAV (Home Educators Association of Virginia) confrence which can be viewed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100010911706079/videos/247591082281280/">here</a></p>
