<p style="Color:ffffff;">Hello, my name is Stephen Baker. I am a sports management major at Bob Jones University. I played soccer and basketball for<br>
Richmond Spirit in Virginia, and was named team captain several years in both sports, as well as when I played football for Victory<br>
Christian Academy.  My dream is to be an athletic director / coach in a middle school or high school. I have competed in a team<br>
consumer science competition for six years, in a competition called <a href="http://www.lifesmarts.org">LifeSmarts</a> where my team represented my home state of Virginia<br>
in national rounds in Florida (2014) and Washington State (2015).</p>
<p>I am also interested in music. I studied piano for 12 years, and participated in Piano Guild for 10 years, receiving high marks. As a<br>
member of Immanuel Baptist Church in Richmond, VA, I sang with the adult choir for six years, singing multiple solo specials as part<br>
of the music ministry. I have also had the privilege of singing the national anthem at the annual HEAV (Home Educators Association<br>
of Virginia) conference which can be viewed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/100010911706079/videos/247591082281280/"> here.</a></p>
